# Flappy-Plane

Flappy-Plane is a fun game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird game but with a twist. Instead of controlling a bird, you'll be piloting a plane through a series of obstacles resembling twin towers. This game serves as a reflection on the tragic events of the 9/11 Attack.

## Gameplay

The objective of Flappy-Plane is simple: navigate your plane through the gaps between the twin towers without crashing into them. Tap or click to make the plane flap its wings and ascend, releasing to descend. Each successful pass through a gap earns you points, but be careful, as hitting a tower will result in a game over.
